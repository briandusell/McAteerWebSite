						<h3>A Liturgy of Acceptance, Unity, and Farewell</h3>
					</div>
					<p>The Church has no specific liturgy for parents who have lost a child through a procured abortion. It might be a good idea to conclude this Program of Reconciliation with a Unity Liturgy. This liturgy represents your return to grace through the sacraments of Reconciliation, Healing of the Sick, Resurrection to new life in the Eucharist and, the deepening of faith through professing Baptismal Vows. The readings and Prayers of the Faithful from the Mass for an unbaptized child have been chosen here would be appropriate. You may, of course, chose your own readings, create your own liturgy.</p>

					<h4>Entrance</h4> 
					<p>(See introduction to liturgy above.)</p>

					<h4>Opening Prayer 'c'</h4>

					<p>O Lord, whose ways are beyond understanding, listen to the prayers of your faithful people; 
					that those weighed down by grief at the loss of this little child may find reassurance at your infinite goodness. 
					We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, forever and ever. <b>Amen.</b></p>

					<h4>Old Testament Reading: Isaiah 25: 6a, 7-8b</h4> 

					<p>The Lord God will destroy death forever On this mountain the Lord of Hosts will provide for all his peoples. 
					On this mountain he will destroy the veil that veils all peoples. The web that is woven all nations; he will destroy death forever. 
					The Lord God will wipe away the tears from all faces.<br/>
					This is the Word of the Lord. <b>Thanks be to God.</b></p>

					<h4>Responsorial Psalm: Psalm 25</h4>

					<p>Antiphon<br/>
					<b>To you, O Lord, I lift up my soul.</b></p>
					<p>Verses<br/>
					Lord, make me know your ways. Lord, teach me your paths. 
					Make me walk in your truth, and teach me; for you are God my Savior. <i>(Antiphon)</i></p>

					<p>Remember your mercy, Lord, and the love you have shown from of old. 
					In your love remember me because of your goodness, O Lord. <i>(Antiphon)</i></p>

					<p>Relieve the anguish of my heart and set me free from my distress. 
					Preserve my life and rescue me. Do not disappoint me, you are my refuge. <i>(Antiphon)</i></p>

					<h4>Gospel Acclamation: Alleluia</h4>

					<p>Verse Revelations 1: 5a-6b<br/>
					Jesus Christ is the firstborn from the dead; glory and kingship be his for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

					<h4>Gospel: Matthew 11: 25-30</h4>

					<p>A reading from the holy gospel according to Matthew.</p>

					<p>At that time Jesus said in reply, "I give praise to you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for although you have hidden 
					these things from the wise and the learned you have revealed them to the childlike. Yes, Father, such has been your gracious will. 
					All things have been handed over to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the 
					Son and anyone to whom the Son wishes to reveal him. Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest. 
					Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am meek and humble of heart, and you will find rest for yourselves. 
					For my yoke is easy and my burden light."<br/> 
					This is the Gospel of the Lord. <b>Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.</b></p>

					<h4>Homily</h4>

					<h4>Act of Penitence</h4>

					<p>We ask God's forgiveness for having sinned against Him.<br/>
					Let us pray to the Lord: <b>Lord, hear our prayer.</b><br/>
					We ask forgiveness from baby, Mary Joseph, against whom we have sinned.<br/>
					Let us pray to the Lord: <b>Lord, hear our prayer.</b></p>

					<h4>Renewal of Baptismal Vows</h4>

					<p>Dear Friends,<br/>
					Through the Pascal mystery we have been buried with Christ in baptism, so that we may rise with him to new life. 
					Ever mindful of our sinfulness and need for redemption, let us renew the promises we made in baptism when we rejected Satan and his works, 
					and promised to serve God faithfully in his Holy Catholic Church.</p>

					<p><i>Priest:</i> Do you reject sin, so as to live in the freedom of God's children?</p>

					<p><i>All:</i> <b>I do.</b></p>

					<p><i>Priest:</i> Do you reject the glamour of evil, and refuse to be mastered by sin?</p>

					<p><i>All:</i> <b>I do.</b></p>

					<p><i>Priest:</i> Do you reject Satan, father of sin and prince of darkness?</p>

					<p><i>All:</i> <b>I do.</b></p>

					<p><i>Priest:</i> Do you believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth?</p>

					<p><i>All:</i> <b>I do.</b></p>

					<p><i>Priest:</i> Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was born of the Virgin Mary, was crucified, died, 
					and was buried, rose from the dead, and is now seated at the right hand of the Father?</p>

					<p><i>All:</i> <b>I do.</b></p>

					<p><i>Priest:</i> Do you believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, 
					the resurrection of the body, and live everlasting?</p>

					<p><i>All:</i> <b>I do.</b></p>

					<p><i>Priest continues:</i> God, the all-powerful Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, has given us a new birth by water and the Holy Spirit, 
					and forgiven all our sins. May he also keep us faithful to our Lord Jesus Christ for ever and ever.</p>

					<p><i>All:</i> <b>Amen.</b><br/></p>

					<p>We now trust in that renewed faith by making our petitions to God:</p>

					<h4>Prayers of the Faithful</h4>

					<p>Let us pray for Mary Joseph (The name given to the aborted baby --Mary/Joseph covers both sexes. If the parents know the 
					sex of their aborted child then they can chose an appropriate name.) and her family and friends, and for all God's people.</p> 

					<p>For Mary Joseph, child of God, that she be held securely in God's loving embrace now and for all eternity.<br/>
					We pray to the Lord. <b>Lord, hear our prayer.</b></p>

					<p>For Mary Joseph's family, especially her mother and father, any brothers and sisters, that they feel the healing power of Christ, 
					the acceptance and forgiveness of Mary Joseph, in the midst of their pain and grief.<br/> 
					We pray to the Lord. <b>Lord, hear our prayer.</b></p>

					<p>For all parents who grieve over the death of their children, that they be comforted in the knowledge that their children dwell with God.<br/>
					We pray to the Lord. <b>Lord, hear our prayer.</b></p>

					<p>For the whole Church, that we prepare worthily for the hour of our death, when God will call us by name, <br/>
					to pass from this world to the next.<br/>
					We pray to the Lord. <b>Lord, hear our prayer.</b></p>

					<p>Lord, God, you entrusted Mary Joseph to our care and now you embrace her in your love. Take Mary Joseph into your keeping, 
					together with all children who have died. Comfort us your sorrowing servants, who seek to do your will and to know your saving peace.</p>

					<p>We ask this through Christ our Lord. <b>Amen.</b><br/></p>

					<h4>Offertory</h4>

					<h4>Canon of the Mass</h4>

					<h4>Communion</h4>

					<h4>Song of Farewell</h4>

					<p>I know that my Redeemer lives: on the last day I shall rise again.<br/>
					<i>Response:</i> <b>On the last day I shall rise again.</b></p>

					<p>I shall see him myself, fact to face: and my own eyes shall behold my savior.<br/>
					<i>Response:</i> <b>On the last day I shall rise again.</b></p>

					<p>Within my heart this hope I cherish; that in my flesh I shall see God.<br/>
					<i>Response:</i> <b>On the last day I shall rise again.</b><br/></p>

					<h4>Blessing of the Parents</h4>

					<p>Compassionate God smooth the hearts of John and Mary and grant that through the prayers of Mary Our Mother, 
					who grieved at the cross of her Son, you may enlightened their faith, give hope to their hearts, and peace to their lives.</p>

					<p>Lord, grant mercy to all the members of this family and comfort them with the hope that one day we will all live with you, 
					with your son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit for ever and ever. <b>Amen.</b></p>

					<p>May God raise you up from your grief. <b>Amen.</b></p>

					<p>May God give you encouragement and strength to accept his will. <b>Amen.</b><br/></p>

					<h4>Final Blessing</h4>

					<p>May almighty God bless you all, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. <b>Amen.</b></p>

					<p>The mass is ended go in peace to love and serve the Lord. <b>Thanks be to God.</b></p>
